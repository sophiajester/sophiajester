# Responsive buttons with CSS vars! (click them, resize viewport to see different sizes & aspect ratios)

 [Watch me code this](https://youtu.be/dkqV-IM52_8) in about 30 minutes (you can speed it up if I'm too slow) . Very clean and compact code, super proud of that. Tested & works fully as intended in Chrome & Firefox on Windows 10. Only partially in Edge (due to lack of `clip-path` support and `calc()` bugs), but still looks decent. And with Edge switching to Chromium, I'm guessing it won't matter anyway.

If you like this demo in particular and my work in general and you want me to be able to continue putting stuff out, please consider one of the following:

* getting me something from my Amazon WishList: [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Y3C4722GXH0I/) / [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2I25W7U0KADSR/)

* [voting for `clip-path` implementation in Edge](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6519995-support-clip-path-property)


* or at least sharing this to show the rest of the world what can be done with CSS on the web these days
